## 👋 About Me

(Please don't mind if my English is broken as English is my second language.)

Lafcadia is my screen name (formerly ChuishenX, also known as Chuishen Qiusha ("吹神求杀")), taken from the legendary writer Lafcadio Hearn. Learning in a foreign language School as a senior high student, I'm now the co-leader and president of [Team OblivionOcean](https://github.com/OblivionOcean). I also have a [personal blog](https://chuishen.xyz) based on Hexo where I post my "work". I'm also openly bisexual. Most of my work is open-sourced and I published most of them on GitHub.

Due to an accident with 2FA, my original account [@ChuishenX](https://github.com/ChuishenX/) is no longer used — however, most of the valuable content is transferred to this account.

My closest colleagues are [@Zhiro](https://github.com/zzhiro/) and [@Fgaoxing](https://github.com/Fgaoxing/).
