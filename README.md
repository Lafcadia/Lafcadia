## 👋 About Me

Lafcadia is my current screen name (formerly [ChuishenX](https://github.com/ChuishenX/), also known as Chuishen Qiusha ("吹神求杀")), which is taken from the legendary writer Lafcadio Hearn. Learning in a foreign language School as a senior high student, I'm now the co-leader and president of [Team OblivionOcean](https://github.com/OblivionOcean). I also have a [personal blog](https://chuishen.xyz) based on Hexo where I post my "work". Most of my programming work is open-sourced, and I have published most of it on GitHub.

Due to an accident with 2FA, my original account [ChuishenX](https://github.com/ChuishenX/) is no longer used — however, most of the valuable content is transferred to this account.

My closest colleagues are [Zhiro](https://github.com/zzhiro/) and [Fgaoxing](https://github.com/Fgaoxing/). I met Zhiro online for the first time in 2019 when I was just a pupil working for him in his studio. I helped him to deploy his first blog. In 2022, he introduced me to Fgaoxing, and we co-created Team OblivionOcean.

## Brief History

Before 2019, I met [Zhiro](https://www.zzzzhi.com/) (formerly known as Tutu) online. I joined a little-known writing group (Xingluo Academy (whose website I wrote about and believe has stopped working for a long time)), and the former members have forgotten it.

In 2019, I started to build my first blog (It no longer works), and the domain was [chuishen.cf](https://chuishen.cf/). I just started using Hexo, and the only project I could think of at that time was ["Du"](https://github.com/Lafcadia/Du).

From 2020 to 2021, due to some personal issues, I quit the Internet.

In 2022, I rebuilt the blog. I met [Fgaoxing](https://www.yt-blog.top/) for the first time online. I joined [TongStarGe](https://github.com/tongstarge), which has sadly stopped operating, established [Team OblivionOcean](https://github.com/OblivionOcean/) and became the president of the team. 

In September 2023, I entered [Hangzhou Foreign Languages School](http://www.chinahw.net/html_en/template/english.html). I also won the second prize in the VEX Robot Asia Open with the HFLS Robotics team. I informally joined the [Tianji Literary Society](https://www.tjwxs.top/) in March 2024.

In June 2024, I formally joined the [Tianji Literary Society](https://www.tjwxs.top/) and served the society as a website administrator and author. I also created an English blog as an English counterpart of the Chinese one, which was still experimental. I was also invited to join the [Garbage Human Studio](https://github.com/GarbageHumanStudio) (GHS). I joined the [Not By AI](https://notbyai.fyi/hi/not-by-ai/) campaign and also contributed to the [Chinese Blog List](https://github.com/zh-blogs/blog-daohang) project. I also started operating on Hack Club and had fun with the Arcade Program.

In September 2024, I became one of the co-creators of [Veritas Literary Society](https://lite.hfls.top/), serving the society as the website admin and EIC. Following the end of our first semester, Veritas soon grew into an important and influential figure and had its impact on many aspects of the students' lives in CAL Center.
