## 👋 About Me

Lafcadia is my current screen name (formerly [ChuishenX](https://github.com/ChuishenX/), also known as Chuishen Qiusha ("吹神求杀")), which is taken from the legendary writer Lafcadio Hearn. Learning in a foreign language School as a senior high student, I'm now the co-leader and president of [Team OblivionOcean](https://github.com/OblivionOcean). I also have a [personal blog](https://chuishen.xyz) based on Hexo where I post my "work". Most of my programming work is open-sourced, and I published most on GitHub.

Due to an accident with 2FA, my original account [ChuishenX](https://github.com/ChuishenX/) is no longer used — however, most of the valuable content is transferred to this account.

My closest colleagues are [Zhiro](https://github.com/zzhiro/) and [Fgaoxing](https://github.com/Fgaoxing/). I met Zhiro online for the first time in 2019 when I was just a pupil working for him in his studio. I helped him to deploy his first blog. In 2022, he introduced me to Fgaoxing, and we co-created Team OblivionOcean.

## Brief History

Before 2019, I met [Zhiro](https://www.zzzzhi.com/) (formerly known as Tutu) online. I joined a little-known writing group (Xingluo Academy (whose website I wrote about and believe has stopped working for a long time)), and the former members have forgotten it.

In 2019, I started to build my first blog (It no longer works), and the domain was [chuishen.cf](https://chuishen.cf/). I just started using Hexo, and the only project I could think of at that time was ["Du"](https://github.com/Lafcadia/Du).

In 2020-2021, due to some personal issues, I quit the Internet.

In 2022, I rebuilt the blog. I met [Fgaoxing](https://www.yt-blog.top/) for the first time online. I joined [TongStarGe](https://github.com/tongstarge), which has sadly stopped operating, established [Team OblivionOcean](https://github.com/OblivionOcean/) and became the president of the team. 

In September 2023, I entered [Hangzhou Foreign Languages School](http://www.chinahw.net/html_en/template/english.html). I also won the second prize in the VEX Robot Asia Open with the HFLS Robotics team. I informally joined the [Tianji Literary Society](https://www.tjwxs.top/) in March 2024.

In June 2024, I formally joined the [Tianji Literary Society](https://www.tjwxs.top/) and served the society as a website administrator and author. I also created an English blog as an English counterpart of the Chinese one, which was still experimental. I was also invited to join the [Garbage Human Studio](https://github.com/GarbageHumanStudio) (GHS). I joined the [Not By AI](https://notbyai.fyi/hi/not-by-ai/) campaign and also contributed to the [Chinese Blog List](https://github.com/zh-blogs/blog-daohang) project.
