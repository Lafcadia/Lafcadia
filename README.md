## 👋 About Me

(Please don't mind if my English is broken as English is my second language.)

Lafcadia is my current screen name (formerly ChuishenX, also known as Chuishen Qiusha ("吹神求杀")), the current name is taken from the legendary writer Lafcadio Hearn. Learning in a foreign language School as a senior high student, I'm now the co-leader and president of [Team OblivionOcean](https://github.com/OblivionOcean). I also have a [personal blog](https://chuishen.xyz) based on Hexo where I post my "work". I'm also openly bisexual. Most of my programming work is open-sourced and I published most on GitHub.

Due to an accident with 2FA, my original account [ChuishenX](https://github.com/ChuishenX/) is no longer used — however, most of the valuable content is transferred to this account.

My closest colleagues are [Zhiro](https://github.com/zzhiro/) and [Fgaoxing](https://github.com/Fgaoxing/). I met Zhiro online for the first time in 2019 when I was just a pupil working for him in his studio. I helped him to deploy his first blog. In 2022, he introduced me to Fgaoxing and we co-created Team OblivionOcean.

## Brief History

Before 2019, I met [TuTu](https://www.tutime.cn/) online. I joined a little-known writing group (Xingluo Academy (whose website was written by me and I believe that it has stopped working for a long time)), and I suppose that the former members have forgotten it.

In 2019, I started to build my first blog (It no longer works), the URL was [https://chuishen.cf/](https://chuishen.cf/). I just started using Hexo, and the only project I could think of at that time was ["Du"](https://github.com/Lafcadia/Du).

In 2020-2021, due to some personal issues, I quit the Internet.

In 2022, I rebuilt the blog, and the domain is still used today. I met [Fgaoxing](https://www.yt-blog.top/) online. I joined [TongStarGe](https://github.com/tongstarge), which has sadly stopped operating, established [Team OblivionOcean](https://github.com/OblivionOcean/) and became the president. 

In 2023, I entered Hangzhou Foreign Language School to study in high school. I also won the second prize in the VEX Robot Asia Open with the team.

In 2024, I joined the Tianji Literary Society and served as a website administrator and author. I also created this blog as an English counterpart of the Chinese one.
